# Restaurtant-App
Ajax call + Jquery + API

This application is all about knowing how to put an AJAX request and handle the response from an API using JQuery. I used Zomato API to show the restaurants that are present in a city.

How it works

A user on selecting a city will be automatically suggested with the top rated restaurants present in the city on typing the restaurant's name in the textbox.

Notes :
There are some comment lines, just uncomment them and see the output in the console of the browser.
I used postman application to write the AJAX,


Requirements:
A proper Internet connection.
Register in the zomato developers website.
Understand the fields of data, required for the API request.
Just see the type of field whether it is an "Header" or a "Parameter" to properly place the request.

I used the "postman" application which outputs AJAX syntax on providing the inputs. Just surf the web for how to use it.
