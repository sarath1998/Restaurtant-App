# Restaurtant-App
Ajax call + Jquery + API

This application is all about knowing how to put an AJAX request and handle the response from an API using JQuery. I used Zomato API to show the restaurants that are present in a city.

How it works

A user on selecting a city will be automatically suggested with the top rated restaurants present in the city on typing the restaurant's name in the textbox.

Notes :
There are some comment lines, just uncomment them and see the output in the console of the browser.

Requirements:
A proper Internet connection.
